    "This document is a thorough overview of my process for building a predictive model for Kaggle's Titanic competition. I will provide all my essential steps in this model as well as the reasoning behind each decision I made. This model achieves a score of 82.78%, which is in the top 3% of all submissions at the time of this writing. This is a great introductory modeling exercise due to the simple nature of the data, yet there is still a lot to be gleaned from following a process that ultimately yields a high score.\n",

    "This exercise is a good example of how far basic feature engineering can take you. It is worth mentioning that I did try various other models before arriving at this one. Some of the other variations I tried were different groupings for the categorical variables (plenty more combinations remain), linear discriminant analysis on a couple numeric columns, and eliminating more variables, among other things. This is a competition with a generous allotment of submission attempts, and as a result, it's quite possible that even the leaderboard score is an overestimation of the true quality of the model, since the leaderboard can act as more of a validation score instead of a true test score. \n",
