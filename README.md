What is this?

At this step : 
- Your notebook is clean and running
- You have a few documented functions
- Your functions are in a specific `.py` file
- Your functions are tested

What is the goal ?
-------------------
The goal at this step is to generate a sphynx documentation.

Following instructor demonstration you will create a documentation using

When I'm done ?

When you are done, please wait for the rest of the group.

For the next step of the practical work, you can either 
keep on working on the code as it is, or checkout branch `5_add_sphinx_doc`
