What is this?
-------------
This is the second branch of this practical work.

At this step your notebook is clean, running, and you have a few functions.

What is the goal ?
-------------------
The goal at this step is to document functions. 

To do that you should use type hinting and docstrings.

Type hinting will help you to use those functions.

Docstrings will help you to quickly build a nice documentation in the next steps.


When I'm done ?
---------------
When you are done, please wait for the rest of the group.

For the next step of the practical work, you can either 
keep on working on the code as it is, or checkout branch `2_comment_functions`

To checkout branch `2_comment_functions` you need to either commit 
or stash your changes : 
```
git stash
git checkout 2_comment_functions
```
