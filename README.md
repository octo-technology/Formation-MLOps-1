What is this?
-------------
At this step :
- Your notebook is clean and running
- You have a few documented functions
- Your functions are in a specific `.py` file
- Your functions are tested
- Your package have a documentation

What is the goal ?
-------------------
The goal at this step is to package your code so that it will be easily installed elsewhere.

Following instructor demonstration you will create a python package.

When I'm done ?
---------------
This is the end of this practical work.

Now you know how to go from an 'ugly' notebook to a documented, tested package.

To see a correction what you should have achieved you can check out branch `7_package`
```shell
git stash
git checkout 7_package
```

Also in branch `7_package` there is an optional task to create a predict notebook using
`pickle` to save and load model.
