# Initial state (0)

![branch build status][badge]

## What is this

This is the initial branch of the practical work.

If you explore the project you will find :

```plain text
    .
    └── formation_indus_ds
        ├── input
        |   ├── test.csv
        |   ├── train.csv
        ├── notebook
        |   ├── titanic.ipynb
        README.md
```

This the state of a data science prototype built by one of your colleagues.

## What is the goal

-------------------
The goal of this first step is to clean the notebook following code practices you just discovered :

- Variables names
- Conventions
- Respect cells order
- Printing
- Removing useless code
- Making short instructions
- Respect immutability
- Create functions

One test to check if you are done is to restart the notebook and run all cells (symbol >>)

## When I'm done

When you are done, please wait for the rest of the group.

For the next step of the practical work, you can either
keep on working on the code as it is, or checkout branch `1_clean_notebook`

To checkout branch `1_clean_notebook` you need to either commit
or stash your changes :

```bash
git stash
git checkout 1_clean_notebook
```
